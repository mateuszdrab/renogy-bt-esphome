# renogy-bt-esphome
ESPHome implementation to pull data from BT-enabled Renogy devices

## Setup
- renogy_batteries.yaml is configured to connect to a single Renogy BT device (currently tested on a BT-2 connected to three batteries in a daisy-chained configuration.) There are TODOs in the yaml that indicate places where updates should be made, or at least pertinent information for the user is available.

  - renogy_battery_utilities.h contains methods to do the payload creation and response parsing for communicating with the BT device.


- renogy_rover.yaml is configured to connect to a Renogy BT device (tested on a BT-2.) There are TODOs in the yaml that indicate place where updates should be made.

  - renogy_rover_utilities.h contains methods to do the payload creation and response parsing for communicating with the BT device.
